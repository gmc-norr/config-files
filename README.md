# Small configuration files for GMC Norr

## nf-core/raredisease

To run the raredisease pipeline in a clinical setting on our cluster, run the following command:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/raredisease \
    --custom_config_base ${CONFIG_FILES}/nf-core \
    -profile rv,clinical,wgs \
    --input samplesheet.csv
```

`$CONFIG_FILES` is the path to the clone of this repo. The `rv` (Region VÃ¤sterbotten) profile is the general cluster config for nf-core and should be used for all nf-core pipelines. For this config there are also two additional profiles: `clinical` and `research`. These are also general, and will decide what priority the jobs will get on the cluster.

The raredisease pipeline in addition has three profiles: `wgs`, `wes` and `mito` which will decide what type of analysis will be run for the data.

The samplesheet used for the input data is *not* an Illumina samplesheet. See the [nf-core/raredisease documentation](https://nf-co.re/raredisease/2.1.0/docs/usage#samplesheet) for details.
